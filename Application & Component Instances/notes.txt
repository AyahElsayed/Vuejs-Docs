- Every Vue application starts by creating a new application instance with the createApp function:

    const app = Vue.createApp({
    /* options */
    })

- The application instance is used to register 'globals' that can then be used by 
  components within that application

- The options passed to createApp are used to configure the root component. 
  That component is used as the starting point for rendering when we mount the application.


- const RootComponent = {
  /* options */
}
const app = Vue.createApp(RootComponent)
const vm = app.mount('#app')

- Unlike most of the application methods, mount does not return the application. 
  Instead it returns the root component instance.

- we often use the variable vm (short for ViewModel) to refer to a component instance.

- While all the examples on this page only need a single component, most real applications are 
  organized into a tree of nested, reusable components
  Root Component
└─ TodoList
   ├─ TodoItem
   │  ├─ DeleteTodoButton
   │  └─ EditTodoButton
   └─ TodoListFooter
      ├─ ClearTodosButton
      └─ TodoListStatistics

- Each component will have its own component instance, vm. For some components, such as TodoItem
