There are four primary ways of adding Vue.js to a project:

   1- Import it as a CDN package on the page
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
   2- Download the JavaScript files and host them yourself
   3- Install it using npm
        npm is the recommended installation method when building large scale applications with Vue
        npm install -D @vue/compiler-sfc => v2
        replaces vue-template-compiler => v3
   4- Use the official CLI to scaffold a project, which provides batteries-included 
   build setups for a modern frontend workflow (e.g., hot-reload, lint-on-save, and much more)
        npm install -g @vue/cli
        Then in the Vue projects, run: vue upgrade --next
